### Air Quality Estimation using Machine Learning

This project is part of a research internship i did from June 2024 to September 2024 in Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia. The project focuses on developing and optimizing machine learning models to estimate PM2.5 air pollutant concentrations in areas lacking direct monitoring. Using techniques like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks, the models enhance air quality monitoring efficiency and coverage.

#### Key Features
- **Data Estimation**: Predict PM2.5 concentrations in unmonitored locations.
- **Temporal Gap Filling**: Address missing data points in air quality time series.
- **Scalability**: Expanded monitoring to over 50 unmonitored locations, reducing dependency on direct sensor data by 40%.
